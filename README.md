<h1 align="center"> Noise Generator</h1>

<div align="center"><code>Noise Generator written using Java with a simple text interface.</code></div>

This is a program primarily targetted towards generating static noises or more specifically static **colored** noises. You can find what they are about [here on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise).

## Running

Use any Java `15+` runtime and just run:

```bash
java sfx_NoiseGenerator.java
```

> You could also use older versions by removing text blocks within the source code (the String wrapped in triple double quotations: """). However, it is highly recommended you use versions 15+ in order to avoid complications.

Once launched, you can utilize a simple command line interface to interact with the program. `Type "help" for a list of commands.`
